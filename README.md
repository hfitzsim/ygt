This is a simple personal goal-tracker application. YGT stands for "You Got This" and after I was frustrated with the existing offerings on the app store, with everything requiring a paid subscription, I decided to build my own responsive web app that meets my needs, for now.

Currently this offers an uncomplicated interface and leverages supabase, mantine, react + typescript.

Users can create goals, edit goals (increment, decrement, specify progress), reset them, and delete them.

I plan to continue building on this app with calendar integration and progress notes for any achievements that deserve highlight.
